        <h1>Java Web Application (Apache Tomcat)</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Java-based web application</p>
        <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Java, HTML, XML, Apache Tomcat</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was a Java-based web application developed as part of a university coursework assignment. The application was deployed using Apache Tomcat and integrated frontend components built with HTML. XML configuration files were used to define application structure and server behavior. The project demonstrated core web development concepts, including server-side processing, application deployment, and request handling.</p>
